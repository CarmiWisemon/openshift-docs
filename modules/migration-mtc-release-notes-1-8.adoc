.Migrated application unable to pull image from internal registry on target cluster

In previous releases, on migrating an application to the target cluster, the migrated application failed to pull the image from the internal image registry resulting in an `application failure`. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2233103[*BZ#2233103*])

.Migration failing on Azure due to authorization issue

In previous releases, on an Azure cluster, when backing up to Azure storage, the migration failed at the `Backup` stage. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2238974[*BZ#2238974*])

[id="known-issues-1-8_{context}"]
== Known issues

This release has the following known issues:

.Old Restic pods are not getting removed on upgrading MTC 1.7.x -> 1.8.x

In this release, on upgrading the MTC operator from 1.7.x to 1.8.x, the old Restic pods are not being removed. Hence, after the upgrade, both Restic and node-agent pods are visible in the namespace. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2236829[*BZ#2236829*])

.Migrated builder pod fails to push to image registry

In this release, on migrating an application including a `BuildConfig` from a source to target cluster, builder pod results in `error`, failing to push the image to the image registry. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2234781[*BZ#2234781*])

.[UI] CA bundle file field is not properly cleared

In this release, after enabling `Require SSL verification` and adding content to the CA bundle file for an MCG NooBaa bucket in MigStorage, the connection fails as expected. However, when reverting these changes by removing the CA bundle content and clearing `Require SSL verification`, the connection still fails. The issue is only resolved by deleting and re-adding the repository. (link:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2240052[*BZ#2240052*])
