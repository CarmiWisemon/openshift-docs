== New features

.Velero Built-in DataMover

One of the primary new features of Velero 1.12 is the new Velero Built-in Data Mover (VBDM). The OADP Operator needs to add configurations, and e2e tests, to support the new VBDM and remove any configuration and testing of the legacy OADP datamover.

Prior to the release of Velero 1.12, OADP 1.1 and 1.2 integrated an OADP-specific datamover based on Volsync into OADP and the OADP-installed Velero version. This took the form of some modifications to Velero core and the Velero CSI plugins, a new VSM plugin, and a separate VSM controller that used Volsync to store Volume data in the BackupStorageLocation. In addition to this, DPA and installation support for the OADP datamover was included in the OADP operator.

In order to integrate VBDM into OADP, all of the above legacy OADP datamover parts will be removed from the OADP operator, the OADP Velero build, and the OADP build of the Velero Plugin for CSI.

.Restic and Kopia

Velero’s File System Backup supports two data movement paths, the restic path and the kopia path.

Velero allows users to select between the two paths:

For backup, the path is specified at the installation time through the uploader-type flag, the valid value is either `restic` or `kopia`, or defaults to kopia if the value is not specified. The selection is not allowed to be changed after the installation.

.GCP Cloud authentication

Allows user to use Google’s short-lived credentials.
The GCP With identity federation (WIF), allows you to use Identity and Access Management (IAM) to grant external identities IAM roles, including the ability to impersonate service accounts. This eliminates the maintenance and security risks associated with service account keys.

.AWS ROSA STS authentication

Allows user to use AWS’s short-lived credentials...



[id="resolved-issues-1.3.0_{context}"]
== Resolved issues

.Restic restore partially failing due to Pod Security standard 

OCP 4.14 introduced pod security standards that meant the `privileged` profile is `enforced`. In previous releases of OADP, this profile caused the pod to receive `permission denied` errors. This issue was caused because of the restore order. The pod was created before the security context constraints (SCC) resource. As this pod violated the pod security standard, the pod was denied and subsequently failed. link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OADP-2420[OADP-2420]


.Restore partially failing for job resource

In previous releases of OADP, the restore of job resource was partially failing in OCP 4.14. This issue was not seen in older OCP versions. The issue was caused by an additional label being to the job resource, which was not present in older OCP versions. link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OADP-2530[OADP-2530]
