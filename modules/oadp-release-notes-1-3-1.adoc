The {oadp-first} 1.3.1 release notes lists new features and resolved issues.

== New features

.OADP 1.3 Data Mover is now fully supported

The OADP built-in Data Mover, introduced in OADP 1.3 as a Technology Preview, is now fully supported for both containerized and virtual machine workloads.

== Resolved issues

.OADP operator now correctly reports the missing region error

Previously, when a user specified `profile:default` without specifying the `region` in AWS Backup Storage Location (BSL) configuration, the OADP operator failed to report the `missing region` error on the Data Protection Application (DPA) custom resource (CR). This update corrects validation of DPA BSL specification for the AWS provider. As a result, the OADP operator reports the `missing region` error.

.Custom labels are not removed from the namespace, where OADP is installed

Previously, the `openshift-adp-controller-manager` pod would reset the labels on the namespace, where OADP is installed. Consequently, this caused synchronization issues for applications requiring custom labels such as Argo CD, leading to improper functionality. With this update, this issue is fixed and custom labels are not removed from the namespace, where OADP is installed.

.OADP `must-gather` image collects CRD’s

Previously, the OADP `must-gather` image did not collect the Custom Resource Definitions (CRD’s) shipped by OADP. Consequently, it was not possible to use the `omg` tool to extract data on the support shell. For example, the `omg get backup` command did not work because `must-gather` was unable to collect CRD’s.
With this fix, `must-gather` now collects CRD’s shipped by OADP and can use the `omg` tool to extract data.

.Garbage collection has the required default frequency

Previously, the `garbage-collection-frequency` field had a wrong description for the default frequency. With this update, the `gc-controller` correctly executes its reconciliation loop every hour by default. As a result, garbage collection now has the expected default frequency.

.Added FIPS Mode flag to the OADP Operator listing

By setting the `fips-compliant` flag to `true`, the FIPS mode flag is now added to the OADP Operator listing in OperatorHub. This feature was enabled since OADP 1.3.0 but did not show up in the Red Hat Container catalog as being FIPS enabled.

.CSI plugin does not panics with nil pointer when `csiSnapshotTimeout` is set to a short duration

Previously, when the `csiSnapshotTimeout` parameter was set to a short duration, the CSI plugin encountered errors on a nil pointer. Sometimes there was a successful completion of a snapshot within a short duration but often it panicked with the partially failed backup, along with the `plugin panicked: runtime error: invalid memory address or nil pointer dereference` error:

With this fix, the following scenarios are possible:

* Sometimes the backup does not fail without any panic errors.
* The backup fails with the `Timed out awaiting reconciliation of volumesnapshot` timeout error and without panic.
