= About Cluster Migration

Velero’s backup and restore capabilities make it a valuable tool for migrating your data between clusters. Cluster migration with Velero is based on Velero’s object storage sync functionality, which is responsible for syncing Velero resources from your designated object storage to your cluster. This means that to perform cluster migration with Velero you must point each Velero instance running on clusters involved with the migration to the same cloud object storage location.

This page outlines a cluster migration scenario and some common configurations you will need to start using Velero to begin migrating data.

There are important steps that you must implement before migrating your cluster. After you follow the migration scenario, you must verify that te your data which was backed up from Cluster 1 is also available on Cluster 2.

https://velero.io/docs/v1.9/migration-case/#migration-scenario[Migration Scenario]: The scenario steps through the migration of resources from Cluster 1 to Cluster 2. In this scenario, both clusters are using the same cloud provider, AWS, and Velero’s AWS plugin.
