= About Cluster Migration

Velero’s backup and restore capabilities make it a valuable tool for migrating your data between clusters. Cluster migration with Velero is based on Velero’s object storage sync functionality, which is responsible for syncing Velero resources from your designated object storage to your cluster. This means that to perform cluster migration with Velero, you must point each Velero instance running on clusters involved with the migration, to the same cloud object storage location.

This page outlines a cluster migration scenario and some common configurations you need, to use Velero to begin migrating data.

There are important steps that you must implement, before migrating data between clusters. After implementing these prerequisite steps, begin the migration scenario. Once the migration scenario is complete, you must verify that the data which you backed up from Cluster 1 is also available on Cluster 2.

Before migrating you should consider several important issues.

This scenario steps through the migration of resources from Cluster 1 to Cluster 2. In this scenario, both clusters are using the same cloud provider, AWS, and Velero’s AWS plugin.
