= About Cluster Migration

OADP's backup and restore capabilities can be used for migrating data between clusters. Cluster migration is based on object storage sync functionality, which is responsible for syncing resources from your designated object storage to your cluster. To perform cluster migration, you must point each OADP instance, running on clusters involved with the migration, to the same cloud object storage location.

There are important prerequisite steps that you must implement, before migrating data from Cluster 1 to Cluster 2.

You must verify that in Cluster 1 and in Cluster 2, the DPA config is as follows:

* The backup store location (BSL) and volume snapshot location, have the same names and paths, to restore resources to another cluster.
* The same object storage location credentials, must be shared across the clusters.

After implementing these prerequisite steps, begin the migration scenario from Cluster 1 to Cluster 2.

Once the migration scenario is complete, you must verify that the data that you backed up from Cluster 1 is also available on Cluster 2.
