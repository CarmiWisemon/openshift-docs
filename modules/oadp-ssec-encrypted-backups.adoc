= OADP SSE-C encrypted backups

Amazon Web Services (AWS) S3 now applies server-side encryption with Amazon S3 managed keys (SSE-S3) as the base level of encryption for every bucket in Amazon S3. It is to note that OpenShift API for Data Protection (OADP) encrypt data via SSL/TLS, HTTPS, and the velero-repo-credentials secret while data is transferred off cluster to storage.

It is recommended to include an additional layer of encryption to prevent backed up data from being unencrypted in case of lost or stolen AWS credentials. The https://github.com/openshift/velero-plugin-for-aws/blob/konveyor-dev/backupstoragelocation.md[OpenShift velero-plugin-for-aws] provides several additional encryption methods, review the configuration options and consider implementing additional encryption.

SSE-C encryption provides Red Hat users server-side encryption with customer-provided keys (SSE-C), so that you can store your own encryption keys. This will provide required additional security if the AWS credentials have been exposed.

[WARNING]
====
it is strongly advised to secure cryptographic keys in a secure and safe manner. Encrypted data and backups will not be recoverable in the absence of the encryption key.
